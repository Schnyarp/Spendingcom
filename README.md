Sales & transfer process (recommended)
-------------------------------------
A standard process reduces risk for both buyer and seller:

1. Initial inquiry and negotiation by email.
2. Letter of Intent (optional) or agreed terms (price, timing, escrow, transfer steps).
3. Open an escrow for the transaction (recommended) with a reputable provider (see below).
4. Buyer deposits funds into escrow.
5. Seller initiates domain transfer:
   - Disable registrar lock;
   - Provide EPP/Auth code to buyer or escrow agent (depending on escrow flow);
   - Update WHOIS/Registrant details per escrow instructions, if required.
6. Buyer accepts transfer at their registrar and confirms domain in escrow.
7. Escrow provider releases funds to seller after successful transfer confirmation and any agreed wait period.
8. Follow up: confirm DNS, nameservers and domain settings.

Recommended escrow providers
----------------------------
- Escrow.com — industry standard for domain transactions (supports domain transfers and domain escrow)
- Sedo (if using their brokerage/marketplace services)
- Escrow services integrated with reputable brokers or law firms (as agreed)

Due diligence checklist for buyers
----------------------------------
Before completing a purchase, perform these checks:

- WHOIS & ownership verification (ask seller for current registrar and WHOIS snapshot)
- Wayback / archive history: https://archive.org/web/
- Backlink and SEO profile (Majestic, Ahrefs, SEMrush — request reports if available)
- Traffic history (Google Analytics, Search Console screenshots if seller can provide) — if traffic is material to price
- Trademark search (USPTO, CIPO, EUIPO or other relevant jurisdictions) for potential conflicts
- Brand/URL conflict search (Google, social platforms, app stores)
- Blacklist / spam checks (check email/hosting reputation if domain was used to send mail)
- UDRP risk assessment: check for trademark owners who might file disputes
- Registrar lock status and any transfer restrictions or pending actions

Technical notes for transfer
----------------------------
- Obtain EPP/Auth code from current registrar when ready to transfer.
- Ensure domain is unlocked and admin email is reachable for authorization.
- If WHOIS privacy is enabled, the owner may need to turn it off during transfer or work through escrow/broker instructions.
- Decide whether buyer will change nameservers immediately or after transfer. For a seamless handover, buyer can set nameservers once transfer is complete.

Assets included (as listed)
---------------------------
- `index.html` — listing/landing page (sample landing page for spending.com provided)
- No additional trademarks, logos or third‑party assets are included unless explicitly transferred and agreed.

Valuation notes & positioning
-----------------------------
- Single-word, category-relevant .com names typically command premium pricing relative to multi-word or niche names.
- Value depends on factors such as perceived commercial utility, search volume for keyword(s), backlink profile, and market demand.
- If you would like a short valuation memo or traffic/key metrics, request them when you contact domain@spending.com — some data can be provided on a per-inquiry basis.

Privacy & legal
---------------
- All negotiations and offers are confidential by default. If you require an NDA, state that in your inquiry.
- Transfers should use an established escrow service and recommended transfer procedures to reduce fraud risk.
- The seller makes no warranty beyond ownership verification. Buyer is responsible for trademark clearance and due diligence.
